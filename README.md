### Hi there üëãüèº

I'm Erika-Joelle Roncal-Schuyler, but you can call me Erika, EJ, or Erielle. I'm a dedicated Filipina Software Engineer with a unique blend of expertise, including a background in Psychology. My journey from psychology graduate to software developer has equipped me with a diverse skill set that combines my empathy and technical aspects to excel in software engineering.

I'm driven by a solid commitment to creating a positive social impact through innovation and tradition. I focus on crafting software solutions that meet industry standards and resonate with users more meaningfully.

As a Navy wife, I've learned the importance of adaptability and resilience. These qualities translate seamlessly into the dynamic world of software engineering. My extensive experience in HR, including a successful mentorship program implementation and skills like full-cycle recruiting and conducting interviews, has allowed me to connect with people, deeply understand their needs, and translate that understanding into user-centric software.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me spending time with my dogs and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate!
